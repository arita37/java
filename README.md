#  Python and Scala/Java and C++ for Machine Learning / Information extraction

This page has re-created to show some my works.

Most (all) the code source  has moved to another Git Private directory for profesionnal reasons.
As high level coding involves a lot of work and high quality research work is quite demanding,
it's difficult to release all the code.

You can't imagine that Google or Windows release all their search engine code....
But they sometimes release some utilities code to make a standard and used by many people.




If you have interest in one of the project below and some code sources,
you can just send me a message  to noelkev0 gmail   , explaining your motivation.

I am usually very open, I will probably reply to you and give access to the code.


These are the projects I have worked or working one:



1. Using Java JVM inside Python in an transparent way: (this is not Jython)
  Example: Apacha Java pacakge and many utilities to compile Java and use Maven

2. Auto documentation for Python: You have imported a new package  with import packagename
   This module generates documentation by parsing the python code and annoting the code, 
   the list of all functions, classes, methods (like Java Doc or Doxygen) in a text file.
   This is very useful if you have a new scientific package with no clue of the API

3. Japanese Text processing using Machine Learning tools. Japanese is notoriously hard language,
   due to the mix of Kanji/Hiragana as well as the grammar complexity and the encoding of their characters
   in PDF. This module extracts any text from any document into a table, where this table is then analyzed under
   various tools.

4.  Pattern recognition/classification of time series/noisy data using Machine Learning.

5.  Hiearchical Decision Tree : Allows to better fit, in a more consistent way, fit very noisy data.

6.  High Quality Stock Index prediction using Forest of Random Forests Binary trees.

7. Research work on Reinforcement / PolicyGradient Decision trees.

8.  Feature Engineering with XGBoost.

7.  Deep Learning tools for input pre-processing (NLP, text and images)

8.  Deep Learning model for Japanese language processing with Grammar models
    (Japanese is particularly difficult, little research is available using Deep Neural network)

9.  Portfolio analysis using Precision Matrix  and Machine Learning Clustering.

10. Monte Carlo Simulation.

11. Random generator using GPU (Cuda) Sobol and Mersenne Twister.

12. Apache Spark tools which can be used from GUI.
